            <h2>What Makes Vietnamese Cuisine Special?</h2>
            <p>Vietnamese cuisine stands as one of the world's most balanced and flavorful culinary traditions. With a history spanning over 4,000 years, Vietnamese food reflects the country's diverse geography, from the mountains of the north to the tropical Mekong Delta in the south. The philosophy of Vietnamese cooking centers on achieving balance—balancing flavors (sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter), balancing nutrients (carbohydrates, fat, protein, minerals, water), and balancing presentation (colors green, red, yellow, white, and black).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>4,000-year culinary tradition rooted in rice cultivation</li>
                <li>Influenced by Chinese rule for 1,000+ years</li>
                <li>French colonial era introduced baguettes, coffee, and pâté</li>
                <li>Three distinct regional cuisines: North (subtle), Central (bold), South (sweet)</li>
                <li>Philosophy: Balance in taste, nutrition, and presentation</li>
                <li>Essential ingredient: Fish sauce (nước mắm)—the soul of Vietnamese cooking</li>
                <li>Rice is the foundation of nearly every meal</li>
                <li>Fresh herbs and vegetables central to every dish</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Northern Cuisine (Hanoi Style)</h3>
                <p>Subtle, refined, balanced. Northern Vietnamese cuisine emphasizes gentle flavors developed over centuries of Chinese influence. Dishes like Phở showcase the region's culinary finesse with clear broths, minimal toppings, and perfect balance. The cooler climate limited fresh spice availability, leading to creativity with broth-based dishes.</p>

                <h3>Central Cuisine (Hue Style)</h3>
                <p>Bold, spicy, artistic. Central Vietnam's royal court heritage shaped its cuisine into an art form. Bún Bò Huế exemplifies this region with complex, deeply flavored broths and careful presentation. The harsh mountain climate drove development of bold, preservative flavors using lemongrass and shrimp paste.</p>

                <h3>Southern Cuisine (Saigon Style)</h3>
                <p>Sweet, diverse, generous. The Mekong Delta's tropical abundance created a fusion cuisine. Dishes like Bánh Xèo and Cơm Tấm showcase sweeter flavors, abundant herbs, and the influence of neighboring countries. Southern cooking emphasizes family sharing and customization, with generous herb trays for each diner.</p>
